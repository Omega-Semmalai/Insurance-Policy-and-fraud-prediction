1. Python Installation
Before starting the project, ensure you have Python installed. You can download the latest version (3.8 or your preferred version) from the official Python website:

2. Required Python Libraries
You will need the following Python libraries for data handling, model building, and visualization. You can install them using pip by running the commands below:
Pandas – For data manipulation and loading the dataset: pip install pandas
NumPy – For numerical operations and array handling: pip install numpy
Scikit-Learn – For preprocessing, model training, and evaluation metrics: pip install scikit-learn
TensorFlow/Keras – For building and training the LSTM model: pip install tensorflow
Keras-Tuner – For hyperparameter tuning with Keras models: pip install keras-tuner

3. Visualization and Plotting Libraries
To visualize the data and the results of the model, you’ll need the following libraries:
Matplotlib – For creating basic plots and visualizations: pip install matplotlib
Plotly – For interactive visualizations (if needed): pip install plotly

4. Streamlit for Web Interface
Streamlit is used to create an interactive user interface for this project. Install it by running the following command:
pip install streamlit
